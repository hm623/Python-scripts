Python Project Repository
This repository contains various Python scripts developed for assignments and a project, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts, data processing, and database operations. These scripts reflect standard practices in fast-moving industries such as film production, media management, and data engineering.

Contents
Assignments:
Assignment 1: Generates an array of random numbers and identifies the largest value—a fundamental operation in data analysis.
Assignment 2: Reads a text file, extracts numeric values, and formats structured output—common in log and metadata processing.
Assignment 3: Processes text data, extracts numerical information, performs calculations, and exports results to a CSV file—essential for data reporting.
Assignment 4: Interacts with a MongoDB database, listing databases and collections while inserting a document—key in modern database-driven applications.
Assignment 5: Uses command-line arguments to read a file, print its contents, and count lines—useful in automated scripting for batch processing.
Project:
Project 1: Processes and transforms data from multiple text files, parses file paths, manages directory structures, and exports formatted data to a CSV file. This type of automation is widely used in the film industry for managing asset locations, metadata extraction, and workflow automation in post-production.
Industry Relevance:
These scripts align with real-world applications in industries that require efficient data handling, including film production, post-production, VFX pipeline automation, and digital asset management. They showcase skills applicable to automating workflows, handling large datasets, and integrating with databases—critical in high-speed environments where accuracy and efficiency are paramount.
